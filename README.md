# PocoCraft-Framework
The PocoCraft framework, designed for you to manage any CLI-enabled server you have, remotely!

This framework has some modules that can be used on your VALVe SrcDS servers.

I am going to periodically update the code and add more examples, so that people can understand how to implement this into their own application or use scenario(s).
